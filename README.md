This is a Starter project for Spring Boot + Spring Security + Vaadin 13.

## Spring Security
It uses default Spring security configurations with in-memory user authentications, for example, an Admin user and a normal user account. 

## Spring Boot + Vaadin 13
It shows examples of how we can use the Grid in Vaadin 13 and on selection, how to display a details frame for editing the values and handle various listener events.
